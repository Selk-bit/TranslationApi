# Flask API for Text Translation Using Selenium

This Flask API provides text translation services by leveraging Selenium to automate interactions with the DeepL website. The API sends text to DeepL, performs the translation through browser simulation, scrapes the translated result, and returns it to the user.

## Features

- **Automation with Selenium**: Uses Selenium to control a web browser programmatically to interact with the DeepL website.
- **XPath Utilization**: Employs XPath to accurately locate HTML elements on DeepL for text input and extraction of translated text.
- **Flask API**: Simple and efficient Flask API to handle requests and responses, making it easy to integrate with other applications or services.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the translation API on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Selenium
- A WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
